Base encoding of data is used in many situations to store or transfer
data in environments that, perhaps for legacy reasons, are restricted
to US-ASCII data.Base encoding can also be used in new
applications that do not have legacy restrictions, simply because it
makes it possible to manipulate objects with text editors.
In the past, different applications have had different requirements
and thus sometimes implemented base encodings in slightly different
ways.Today, protocol specifications sometimes use base encodings in
general, and "base64" in particular, without a precise description or
reference.Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is often
used as a reference for base64 without considering the consequences
for line-wrapping or non-alphabet characters.The purpose of this
specification is to establish common alphabet and encoding
considerations.This will hopefully reduce ambiguity in other
documents, leading to better interoperability.
